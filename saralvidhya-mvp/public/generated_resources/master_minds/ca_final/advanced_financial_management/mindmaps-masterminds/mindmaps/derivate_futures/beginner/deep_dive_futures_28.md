## 🔬 Advanced Context & Institutional Insights

In deep dive mode, we explore the institutional application and regulatory background of this concept. Under SEBI rules, Indian derivatives are subject to standard margins (SPAN + Exposure) and are tightly regulated to ensure systemic safety.

### Quantitative Modeling & Mathematical Context

> **Model Parameters:** Cost of Carry, SPAN Risk Scenarios, or Black-Scholes PDE depending on topic.

Mathematically, the derivatives market represents a zero-sum game because the net payoff vector is zero at all times:
$$\sum_{i=1}^{M} \Pi_i(S_T) = 0$$
where $\Pi_i$ is the payoff of participant $i$ and $M$ is the total number of participants. While the spot equity market grows over time as corporate profits increase, derivatives only partition and trade that risk. They facilitate risk transfer (e.g., from hedgers to speculators), which can improve economic welfare even though the net trading payoff remains zero.
