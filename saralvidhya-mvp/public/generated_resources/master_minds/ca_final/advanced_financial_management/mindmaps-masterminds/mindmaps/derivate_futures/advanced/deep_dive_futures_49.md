## 🔬 Advanced Context & Institutional Insights

In deep dive mode, we explore the institutional application and regulatory background of this concept. Under SEBI rules, Indian derivatives are subject to standard margins (SPAN + Exposure) and are tightly regulated to ensure systemic safety.

### Quantitative Modeling & Mathematical Context

> **Model Parameters:** Cost of Carry, SPAN Risk Scenarios, or Black-Scholes PDE depending on topic.

The Net Cost of Carry $q = r - d$ determines the drift of the futures price process. In a risk-neutral world, the expected growth rate of the spot asset is the risk-free rate $r$. Since the asset pays a continuous dividend yield $d$, the capital gains growth rate of the spot price is $r - d$. The futures price, which pays no dividends, must grow at the rate of the spot asset's capital gains, meaning $F_t = S_t e^{(r-d)(T-t)}$, identifying $r - d$ as the net carrying rate.
