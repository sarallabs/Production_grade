## 🔬 Advanced Context & Institutional Insights

In deep dive mode, we explore the institutional application and regulatory background of this concept. Under SEBI rules, Indian derivatives are subject to standard margins (SPAN + Exposure) and are tightly regulated to ensure systemic safety.

### Quantitative Modeling & Mathematical Context

> **Model Parameters:** Cost of Carry, SPAN Risk Scenarios, or Black-Scholes PDE depending on topic.

MTM is the clearinghouse's primary risk mitigation tool. By revaluing positions daily to the settlement price, the clearinghouse prevents the accumulation of large, uncollateralized losses. The daily cash flow adjustment is:
$$\text{MTM}_t = (F_t - F_{t-1}) \times \text{Lot Size} \times N$$
where $F_t$ is the day $t$ closing settlement price and $N$ is the number of contracts. This daily cash settlement changes the pricing dynamics of futures compared to forwards, as the daily cash flows are subject to reinvestment at the short-term risk-free rate, introducing interest rate risk to futures pricing models.
