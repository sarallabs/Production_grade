## 🔬 Advanced Context & Institutional Insights

In deep dive mode, we explore the institutional application and regulatory background of this concept. Under SEBI rules, Indian derivatives are subject to standard margins (SPAN + Exposure) and are tightly regulated to ensure systemic safety.

### Quantitative Modeling & Mathematical Context

> **Model Parameters:** Cost of Carry, SPAN Risk Scenarios, or Black-Scholes PDE depending on topic.

Under continuous compounding, if a stock pays a discrete dividend $D_i$ at time $t_i$ (where $t_i < T$), the futures price is:
$$F_0 = (S_0 - D_i e^{-r t_i}) e^{rT}$$
where $D_i e^{-r t_i}$ is the present value of the dividend discounted to the present. The subtraction of the dividend present value from the spot price reflects that the holder of the futures contract does not receive the dividend cash flow, which instead goes to the spot holder. The spot price drops by $D_i$ on the ex-dividend date, and the futures price converges to $S_T$ at maturity.
