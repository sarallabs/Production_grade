## 🔬 Advanced Context & Institutional Insights

In deep dive mode, we explore the institutional application and regulatory background of this concept. Under SEBI rules, Indian derivatives are subject to standard margins (SPAN + Exposure) and are tightly regulated to ensure systemic safety.

### Quantitative Modeling & Mathematical Context

> **Model Parameters:** Cost of Carry, SPAN Risk Scenarios, or Black-Scholes PDE depending on topic.

The Maintenance Margin is the minimum collateral level required to sustain an open position. If the equity in the margin account, $E_t = \text{Initial Margin} \pm \sum \text{Daily MTM}_t$, falls below the Maintenance Margin $M_m$:
$$E_t < M_m$$
The client is issued a margin call. Under US and international exchange guidelines, the client must deposit Variation Margin to restore the account balance back to the Initial Margin level. In India, SEBI requires that the margin account must be maintained at the full SPAN + Exposure level daily, meaning any shortfall must be cleared before the next trading day.
